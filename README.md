# Walkthrough-Demo
This is a demo project for "OnBoarding Screens" which can be furhter used for creating your own reference screens. 
I have followed tutorials of "Simon Archer" for how to use this and add some extra functionality to the reference "Walkthorugh Pages". Here is the first video of the three part tutorial series: https://youtu.be/tNCsQe5vfRk
# Platform
Developed using Xcode 8.3 beta_2 and iOS 10.3
# BWWalkthrough
Base code repository used: https://github.com/ariok/BWWalkthrough
# Stackoverflow
The main purpose for a "Walkthorugh/Welcome Screen" is to be visible only at initial launch of the app, so for that you can refer this link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28313201/xcode6-swift-how-to-make-a-screen-show-only-on-initial-launch
# Important Note
There is no backend functionality for "Login" and "SignUp" buttons present at the moment. These are just pages which I have created and formated according to the different iPhone screen sizes. It would be much appreciated if GitHub community could contribute in those functionalities which are missing.
